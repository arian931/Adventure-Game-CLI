Command Line Adventure Game - players must travel between different countries and obtain a key in order to complete the game

Welcome to Arian's World Map Adventure Game! Your objective is simple: Enter North Korea. You will begin your quest in Pakistan, where you will have access to the entire world, with the exception of the Americas, Greenland, and North Korea. In order to gain access to the Americas, you must locate the return plane ticket somewhere in the continent of Africa. You must then use that ticket to travel to the Americas, acquire the Diplomatic Passport needed to enter North Korea, and then return to Africa where you will continue your quest. Good luck! Along the way you may encounter random objects in several countries; they are irrelavant and simply there because they are required in this assignment!
